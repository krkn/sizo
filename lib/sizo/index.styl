// Sizo

// kouto swiss must be imported before sizo, so we check the existence of kouto-swiss global variable
if( ks-imported isnt yes )
    @import "kouto-swiss"

// By default, only import core (vars & mixins).
// Since all components of sizo are outputing css code, users would choose to import what they wants
@import "core"
